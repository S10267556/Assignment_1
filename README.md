One lone tree

This project is about a reforestation organisation who wants users to donate to them, so that they are able to continue doing what they do.

Design proess
The site's users are people who are passionate about the environment and want to help the cause of the company, which is reforestation. They would want to donate to this charity. The site users may also be people who are curious about what this charityâ€™s cause is and want to learn more about it.

Having this project allows users to know more about what this organisation has done, as well as allow for them to donate to them to support their cause. It also includes a personal story of the founder, for users to better understand why they do what they do.

Features
-Allows users to be able to navigate though the diffrent pages from the navigation bar
-Having the users be able to use the website across platforms though the responsive design
-Shows users increasing numbers of trees planted as well as volunteers, to convince them that this organisation is trustworthy

Features to implement
-Have a pop up which tells users that their input of email/donation was successful
-Verify that infomation inputted into the email or phone number section is correct, meaning that it must have a @gmail or related ending.





Testing

1) Newsletter email:
i. go to the home page
ii.scroll down to the bottom to find the newsletter
iii. input random letters without the email endings
iv. see if it accepts your input

2) Links to other pages:
i.Go to the other pages though the home page using the nav bar
ii. Go to the other pages through the about us page using the nav bar
iii. Go to the other pages through the donations page using the nav bar
iv. resize screen and repeat i-iii
v. scroll down on each of the pages and check the other buttons which lead to the other pages
vi. Go to the footer of each oage, and check that all social media link is working correctly

3) Responsive design:
i: Go to each page, and resize the screen
ii:make them as small as you can to see how far you can go

The projects looks normal on microsoft edge, and is responsive when resized. However, when resized too small, some parts of the website in the home page do not size down enough, causing them to protrude. 

The project is also normal and working on google chrome.

A problem with the submission parts of the newsletter email or the donation infomation is that it opens up my files.
