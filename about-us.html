                <p id="back-text">This organisation was founded by a pair of siblings, Carl Sherman and Agnes Sherman. It was founded in the year 2015, 5 years after the incident which led both siblings down this path. Both Carl and Agnes have been close ever since young, wherever one went, the other would follow. So, it was no doubt that working together would result in great success, due to their synergy. <br><br>
                    However, what lead to them finding an interest in reforestation was an incident that happened to them in 2010. Before that, neither sibling had cared much about trees, or anything related to it. Not even when there were the constant buzzing of chainsaws disrupting their waking hours, chopping down the trees behind their house. Instead, they were always kept busy, having to find work, day in and day out, to support their family, which consisted of their retired elderly parents as well as themselves. Carl often worked as physical labour, while Agnes had to struggle juggling a part-time job while she did her studies. <br><br>
                    It was only that one stormy night, that both siblings received a call from their parents. They sounded out of breath, panicked, shocked. Both siblings had rushed home. Just to find that they no longer had one anymore. <br><br>
                    A landslide had occurred. The house which they had spent their childhoods, as well as the entirety of their lives in, had been destroyed. All the memories and items they held dear to their hearts, wiped away by a single landslide.  <br><br>
                    They would later find out that the only thing stopping that landslide were the trees which grew behind their house, which had been cut down earlier that year for resources. They sometimes wonder if only there had been one more tree up on that hill. Would things have turned out differently? Thus, that is where the company’s name also came from. <br><br>
                    Nowadays, the Sherman family are doing much better. This organization has brought them a lot of recognition, allowing them to live their lives as they want, no longer living hand to mouth. Carl no longer finds his physical work tiring, getting to do something that he is passionate about, while Agnes, who if you don’t see working beside Carl, may be doing research in the labs, or speaking out about the importance of the trees. <br><br>
